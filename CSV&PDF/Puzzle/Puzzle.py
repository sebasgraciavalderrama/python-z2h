# Task 1 - Use Python to extract the Google Drive link from the .csv file. (Hint: Its along the diagonal from top left to bottom right).
import csv, re

# Open the file
data = open('find_the_link.csv', encoding='utf-8')
# Call csv.reader
csv_data = csv.reader(data, delimiter=',')

# Iterate the list of lists
for item in data_lines:
    for character in item:
        # Regex to identify which characters are different from a number.
        char = re.search(r'\D', character)
        # If the regex does not return a valid find (any character different from a number)
        # we move on until we find the next valid find.
        if char is not None:
            # We add the character to the list
            url_by_char.append(character)
# Since we have a list, we now join it and store the resulting string in a variable
url = ''.join(url_by_char)

# Task 2 - Task Two: Download the PDF from the Google Drive link (we already downloaded it for you just in case you canâ€™t download from Google Drive) and find the phone number that is in the document.
